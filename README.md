# Demonstration for Drb
Sample code to show the usage of Open sources libraries Drb, DrbCortex and DrbImage.

The inital import aims to demonstrate the loading of a product, checks if it contains image and convert it into an other format.
Embeded Ontology is Alos, and tests were performed on ALOS PRISM datasets. But with adding others ontologies, it will be possible to handle more datasets.


Please do not hesitate to comment.
